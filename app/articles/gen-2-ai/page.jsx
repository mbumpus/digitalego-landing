      <p className="mb-4">Gen 1 AI tools made us faster. Gen 2 AI tools will make us wiser.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The first generation of generative AI, at least what most people know today, gave us copilots. These systems autocomplete our thoughts, summarize documents, optimize email replies, and finish our code.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They’re brilliant. Fast. Incredibly useful.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But they’re not reflective.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They follow. They echo. They align. What they don’t do is challenge us.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They don’t simulate competing values. They don’t expose blind spots. They don’t stress-test our decisions.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And as AI begins to mediate not just what we do but how we think, that’s no longer enough.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">🧭 What Is Gen 2 AI?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Gen 2 AI doesn’t just respond. It reflects.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It simulates reasoning. It models tension. It returns not just the answer you expect, but the alternative you’ve been avoiding.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Gen 2 systems are not faster tools. They’re cognitive partners, built to help us think better, not just act faster.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Where Gen 1 AI is built for efficiency, Gen 2 AI is built for insight.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">🧠 Why This Shift Matters</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We’re entering an era of outsourced cognition.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">LLMs now write, summarize, propose, and coach. But tools that optimize for relevance and agreement are dangerous when applied to judgment, values, or strategic alignment.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">The problem isn’t that AI might get the facts wrong. It’s that it might get your thinking too right — without depth.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Gen 2 AI interrupts that loop.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It brings back friction: designed, deliberate, constructive friction. It simulates the voices in the room you forgot to invite: your past self, your quiet doubt, your future consequences.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">🧪 What Gen 2 AI Looks Like</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Let’s be clear: Gen 2 AI doesn’t mean “smarter chatbots.” It means a new cognitive interface.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">At DigitalEgo.ai, we’ve begun to build this.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>➤ DigitalEgo™</strong><br/>A reflective persona tuned to your values, history, and blind spots. Think of it as a mirror with memory — not to mimic you, but to surface what matters when you forget it.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>➤ AI Cabinet™</strong><br/>A multi-agent simulation of dissent and deliberation. Modeled on real-world committees, these personas argue, interrogate, and push back — not to reach consensus, but to expand your understanding.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">These aren’t dashboards. They’re dialogic scaffolds. They don’t just help you act. They help you think.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">🔍 Use Cases Already Emerging</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Executive coaching: Leaders surface misalignments through reflective dialogue with DigitalEgo.</li>
        <li>Strategic foresight: Teams simulate decision impact using AI Cabinet-style stakeholder debates.</li>
        <li>Personal clarity: Individuals test internal contradictions through role-based thought rehearsal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Unlike copilots, these systems slow you down — on purpose. Because depth matters more than speed when the stakes are high.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">🤝 From Tools to Thought Partners</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">AI won’t replace human thinking. But it will increasingly mediate it.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Gen 1 systems complete your sentences. Gen 2 systems complete your tension.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">They think with you. Not just for you.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That’s the shift: from utility to augmentation, from output to insight, from interaction to internal dialogue.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">🔈 A Call to Builders, Designers, and Decision-Makers</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">If you’re building systems that simulate dialogue, surface friction, or model competing perspectives — you’re building Gen 2 AI.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If your AI doesn’t just assist but reflects, questions, and mirrors values — you’re building Gen 2 AI.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And if you believe the next leap in intelligence isn’t technical but reflective, ethical, and relational — then let’s shape this next generation together.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">🚀 Where to Start</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Explore what we’re building at DigitalEgo.ai. Or try Jules™, our alpha-stage reflective persona, built to challenge — not just assist.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But more importantly, ask yourself:</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><em>What kind of AI do we need — not to help us type faster, but to help us think better?</em></p>
      <p className="mb-4">That’s Gen 2.</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><strong>Let’s define it before someone flattens it.</strong></p>
