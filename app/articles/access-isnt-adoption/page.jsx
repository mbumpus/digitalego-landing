<p className="mb-4">AI has become more accessible than ever. Tools are everywhere. APIs are cheap. Models are getting open-sourced daily.</p>
<p className="mb-4">But access doesn’t equal adoption. Just because a system is available doesn’t mean it’s usable. And just because it’s usable doesn’t mean it’s empowering.</p>
<p className="mb-4">Real adoption starts with alignment. That means systems need to understand who they’re talking to. What matters to them. How they think. What they’re trying to accomplish—and how they prefer to get there.</p>
<p className="mb-4">Until we design for identity, we’ll keep confusing exposure with empowerment.</p>
