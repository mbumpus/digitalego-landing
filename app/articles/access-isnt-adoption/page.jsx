      <p className="mb-4">DigitalEgo™ empowers alignment through persona-based design, not just automation.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">AI won’t feel like a revolution until it feels like you.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Democratization isn’t about access. It’s about alignment.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">We’ve been here before.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Online banking gave us debit cards before we understood overdraft fees. Robinhood put stocks in our pocket before explaining what “volatility” meant. The tools were there. The confidence wasn’t.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Now AI is following the same path, only faster and with much higher stakes.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">Cheaper ≠ Accessible</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Yes, ChatGPT is free. Claude and Gemini are a click away. But availability alone doesn’t equal empowerment. Most people still don’t know:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>What to ask</li>
        <li>How to judge responses</li>
        <li>If the AI even understands them</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">This isn’t a user problem. It’s a design failure.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Dropping a chatbot in someone’s lap doesn’t make them powerful. It makes them confused, and sometimes even more dependent.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">Access is not adoption. It’s not belonging.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">You don’t adopt a system you don’t trust.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">You don’t trust a system that doesn’t see you.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">And you won’t feel seen by a tool that wasn’t built with your identity, values, or voice in mind.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">This is where most of today’s AI “democratization” efforts fall flat. They stop at the login screen.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">Real Empowerment Starts With Reflection</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">The future of AI isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s many-sizes-for-everyone.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It’s not a universal assistant. It is your Cabinet:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>A strategist who helps you think clearer</li>
        <li>A devil’s advocate who keeps you honest</li>
        <li>A hype persona who reminds you who you are</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">Not just tools. Personas.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Not just commands. Conversations.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">This Is Gen 2 AI</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Gen 1 AI made us faster. Gen 2 will make us aware.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Where Gen 1 autocompletes your sentence, Gen 2 helps you confront your assumptions.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It’s not smarter because it knows more. It’s smarter because it knows you.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">Building the Mirror</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">At DigitalEgo.ai, we’re building this future now:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>AI personas designed to reflect your thought process</li>
        <li>Modular identities that adapt to your values and cognitive style</li>
        <li>A Cabinet system that supports not just answers, but decisions</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">This is more than a productivity boost. It’s a chance to reclaim agency in the most powerful systems we’ve ever built.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">If AI Doesn’t Feel Like You, It Isn’t for You</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">We say AI is for everyone. But until people recognize themselves in the system, they’ll always stay at the edge of it.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Empowerment begins with recognition.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Recognition begins with reflection.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Reflection begins with a system designed not to replicate you… but to respect you.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">Let’s Build Something Better</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">If you’ve ever opened an AI tool and thought:</p>
      <p className="mb-4"><em>“This doesn’t sound like me…”</em></p>
      <p className="mb-4">That’s not a user error. That’s a design flaw.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It’s time for Gen 2 AI to grow up — and grow inward.</p>
