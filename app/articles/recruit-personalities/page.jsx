      <p className="mb-4">Most people approach prompt engineering like it’s spellcasting. Use the right incantation, and magic happens.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">But prompts aren’t the problem. The interface is. We’re still talking to models like they’re single-minded servants—instead of building systems that think like collaborators, mentors, teammates, advisors.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">That’s where persona-based AI comes in.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">When you define the personality, values, cognitive style, and preferred language patterns of an agent, you don’t need to prompt it like a puppet. You let it reason with you like a partner.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Good personas don’t just follow—they challenge. They don’t just reflect tone—they represent perspectives. They help you test ideas, reveal gaps, and surface priorities.</p>

      <p className="mb-4">Prompt engineering says: “Be specific.”<br />
      Persona modeling says: “Be surrounded.”</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">Why Personas Beat Prompts</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Because people don’t just think in queries. They think in roles. Perspectives. Contradictions. Committees.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">Prompts assume the user must always know what to ask. Personas can nudge, provoke, and respond—shifting from reactive to reflective dialogue.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">It’s the difference between typing a command… and holding a conversation.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">How We Build This at DigitalEgo.ai</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Every DigitalEgo persona includes:</p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
        <li>Core traits (temperament, assertiveness, emotional tone)</li>
        <li>Belief scaffolds (what they value and how strongly)</li>
        <li>Language patterns (syntax, metaphor, sentence length)</li>
        <li>Memory & focus (what they care about, what they ignore)</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4">The result? A character-driven, reflective AI that doesn’t just talk—it *thinks with you*.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">Examples in the Wild</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">• Jules™ — a warm, Socratic advisor persona who helps clarify difficult decisions</p>
      <p className="mb-4">• Baron von Boost™ — an unfiltered, high-energy hype persona designed to push confidence through the roof</p>
      <p className="mb-4">• The AI Cabinet™ — a multi-agent deliberation system where custom personas debate, challenge, and converge</p>

      <p className="mb-4">This isn’t fanfic for bots. This is the next interface layer of cognitive tooling.</p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">The Takeaway</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">Stop trying to write the perfect prompt. Start recruiting better personalities.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">If your AI doesn’t know how to think *with* you, it’s not ready to work *for* you.</p>
