<p className="mb-4">Most people approach prompt engineering like it’s spellcasting. Use the right incantation, and magic happens.</p>
<p className="mb-4">But prompts aren’t the problem. The interface is. We’re still talking to models like they’re single-minded servants—instead of building systems that think like collaborators, mentors, teammates, advisors.</p>
<p className="mb-4">That’s where persona-based AI comes in. When you define the personality, values, cognitive style, and preferred language patterns of an agent, you don’t need to prompt it like a puppet. You let it reason with you like a partner.</p>
<p className="mb-4">Stop prompt engineering. Start team building.</p>
